Software engineering can seem daunting for beginners. There’s tons of articles, blogs, and YouTube videos about building various features but it can be quite a task to find a single tutorial that details frontend and backend knowledge together. For instance, it wouldn’t take long to find a step-by-step article on how to build a React app or one on how to connect a database. Finding one that describes both and how to combine one with the other is a little more difficult.

This tutorial is meant to solve that very problem. Here, we will build a search directory web app for local businesses. The app will cover Javascript, Node.js, Express, React, React Router, MongoDB, Webpack, Sass/CSS, HTML and querying data from an API and from local storage. Because this is so much information, the tutorial will be broken into multiple parts.

The tutorial will teach you how to complete an app that looks like the below:
