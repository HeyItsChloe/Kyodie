Software engineering can seem daunting for beginners. There’s tons of articles, blogs, and YouTube videos about building various features but it can be quite a task to find a single tutorial that details frontend and backend knowledge together. For instance, it wouldn’t take long to find a step-by-step article on how to build a React app or one on how to connect a database. Finding one that describes both and how to combine one with the other is a little more difficult.

The app will cover Javascript, Node.js, Express, React, React Router, MongoDB, Webpack, Sass/CSS, HTML and querying data from an API and from local storage.
